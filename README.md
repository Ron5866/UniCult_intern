# Structured Lesson Content & Ops Reflection

This repository contains the completed work for the internship assignment based on the video:  
**"Ben Kelly - How To Buy A Business That Will Cash Flow From Day 1"**  

## 📘 Task A: Structured Lesson Content

This task involved generating educational content using AI based on the video. The deliverables include:

- **Lesson Reading Material** (120–150 words)
- **Learning Objectives** (3 bullet points)
- **Quiz** (3 MCQs with correct answers & 1-sentence explanations)
- **Practical Exercise** (1–2 short activities)
- **Slug** (lowercase, hyphenated format)
- **AI Prompt Used + Output** (included for review and transparency)

## 🛠️ Task C: Ops Reflection

In this task, I proposed one automation solution using tools like **Airtable**, **Zapier**, or **Make**, or a simple script/pseudocode to scale content generation and quality assurance.

The focus was on describing how content like Task A can be generated and reviewed efficiently at scale with automation workflows.
